# Pokedex

This project is a pokedex,allowing users to look up pokemons by name & id, as well as filter them by different criterias (height,weight,type,generation etc..).
It also allows users to add pokemons to a list of favorites, for quick access.
Each pokemon also has its own profile, in which more information can be found.
Finally, the project also includes a pokemon guessing minigame ("who's that pokemon?").

## How it's made

Technologies used:

-   React
-   Typescript
-   Styled-Components
-   Axios

We chose to get the pokemon information & images by making calls to the https://pokeapi.co/ api. Which is a free and extensive api, <u>but please note that because all images were obtained from the api, the image quality in the project reflect what was provided by the api</u>.
